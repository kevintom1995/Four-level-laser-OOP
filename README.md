# Four-level-laser-OOP
Object-oriented design and implementation of a python toolbox for solving rate equations of a four level laser. 
- Successfully executed the numerical simulation of the non-dimensionalised rate equations of a four-level laser system by utilizing both the Runge-Kutta and Euler methods in conjunction with coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).
- Analysed the resulting trends of number densities and energy over time for various pump rates, and comparing these findings with experimental data. The agreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental results validates the accuracy of the simulation.
